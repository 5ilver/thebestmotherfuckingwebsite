  h1 This is the #[i best] motherfucking website.
  p.st Really, it is.
  h2 Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?
  p You probably build websites by using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite](.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
  p <span class="wr">WRONG</span>, motherfucker.
  h2 The best kick-ass website
  p Let me describe the #[i real] perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite]s:
  ul
   li This shit doesn't weight a ton (in fact it's just 16,86 KB when the 73KB cat picture below is removed)
   li This page weights in total 90.36KB, 87.47% less than the <a href="https://google.com/">Google home page</a>
   li Still fits on your iPhone 1st gen (altough it doesn't work on your fucking 16x32 Tamagotchi)
   li Looks #[i almost] the same on every damn screen
   li Every asshole that visit this website can use it without any problem
   li Shit is #[i even more] legible than the fucking two versions before - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website
   li I don't load massive images or scripts just because I don't give a fuck about who still uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a>
   li This website uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans"
   li There is no need to load your damn jQuery or jQueryUI with all his fucking styles and shits. Neither Angular or any other framework, just plain HTML, CSS3 and JS.
   li Doesn't include any tracking service <small>this website does</small>
   li Well, images aren't forbidden, but when it's available an SVG #[i JUST USE IT].
   li Use #[i some] fucking #[span#rbw.colored colors].
   li Links doesn't really need to keep that #[span.sb shitty blue] the browser is giving them: neither that #[span.sv violetish color] when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/2980b9">nice color</a>
  h2 Well guess what, motherfucker:
  p This website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">guy</a> and the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy before him</a>.
  p Why?
  ul
    li It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you.
    li It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gTLD">gTLDs</a> available out there (.website)
    li It was made by using even the TLD part: bestmotherfucking.website
    li It uses the kickassing <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> CA
    li It runs on <a href="https://nginx.com/">nginx</a>: the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server
    li It uses <a href="js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js">a custom version</a> of the awesome <a href="http://jquery.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery</a> /s
    li It doesn't use a single media query <small>well, not really</small>
    li It probably doesn't support all the web browser, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from <a href="https://microsoft.com/ie">the crap he uses</a> to <a href="https://mozilla.com/firefox">a much cooler browser</a>
    li It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript <img src="img/js.svg"/>, CSS3 <img src="img/css3.svg"/> and HTML5 <img src="img/html5.svg"/>
    li It's Open Source and on <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/">Github</a>.
  h2 Put even less contrast
  p Yeah, a #[span.foufoufou #444 is cool] but a #[span.fivfivfiv #555 is better].
  p We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite].
  h2 Size matters, yeah, but don't exagerate
  p Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exagerate in size, but neither make an ant-compatible text.
  h2 Put some pictures
  div.fancyPositioning
    div.picture-left
     img(src="img/cat.jpg")
     p.caption A cat, just to keep the context of the website.
    div.tleft
     p We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite] so include some pictures to give a context.
     p The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.
     p You see that fancy cat? He's happy, so should you.

  h2 Yes, even this is satire.
  p But this doesn't mean you should load your #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite] with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users!
  blockquote
    span Good design is as little design as possible.
    author Some german motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com
  p That's not entirely true, look at that #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite]. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.

  h2 Epilogue
  p Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"><span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</a></a> and the <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"><span class="mfw">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</span></a>.
  p Despite what was said here they're beautyful and truly one of the best websites on the internet (even tough this is still #[span.mfw thebestmotherfuckingwebsite]), so go check em out.
  p Seriously, follow some of the advices we told you, they'll "make the web great again" #[span.citneed Cit. needed]
